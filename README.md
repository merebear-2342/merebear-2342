- 👋 Hi, I’m @merebear-234.
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring computer science in general! I joined GitHub in accordance with a Havard summer course that I'm taking. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of more advanced programs--namely Java--as opposed to Scratch and Python, which I've spent time with in the past. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on class projects and the like. 
- 📫 How to reach me: shoot an email my way @meredithhrichardson@gmail.com.
